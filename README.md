# Data-driven Repayment Performance Project

## Overview:

The project involves analyzing a crowdfunding microfinance platform that connects entrepreneurs in developing countries with investors. The CEO of the company has identified that the platform’s business model isn't functioning effectively, and they need help understanding why. The task is to identify the problem, propose potential solutions, and present these ideas to the CEO.

## Key Components of the Project:

### 1. Company Overview:
- The platform facilitates crowdfunding for entrepreneurs in developing countries.
- It operates as a two-sided platform:
  - **Entrepreneurs** post their project proposals.
  - **Investors** review and bid on these proposals, deciding how much to invest and under what terms.
- The platform uses an auction mechanism where proposals with lower interest rates attract more investments, pushing out those with higher rates.
- The company, along with providers and administrators, charges fees for the services rendered.

### 2. Problem at Hand:
The platform’s market is "thin," meaning it faces challenges such as:
- **Difficulty for entrepreneurs** to prove their value upfront, making it hard to secure financing.
- **High risk**, leading to unfavorable loan terms (e.g., high interest rates or collateral requirements).
- **Information asymmetry**, where important details about projects are difficult to verify or understand.
- **Low reputation effects**, as entrepreneurs on the platform often have little track record, leading to issues like adverse selection and moral hazard.

### 3. Critical Factors:
- Entrepreneurs face high financing costs due to limited access to reliable information.
- Investors, although numerous, may struggle to identify viable projects due to a lack of information or misleading details.
- The market is "thin," meaning it lacks depth in terms of trust, reputation, and reliable data.

### 4. Proposals and Data Provided:
Entrepreneurs provide detailed proposals, including:
- Financial needs, loan size, repayment terms, business plan, location pictures, and descriptions.
- Prescreening and co-writing of proposals are handled by “providers.”
- The platform has successfully funded 93% of 5,041 projects but has a high default rate, with only 44% of projects being repaid.

### 5. The CEO’s Challenge:
- **Core Question:** Why are so many projects defaulting despite a high funding rate?
